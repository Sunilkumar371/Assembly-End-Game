Assembly: End Game Project

Overview

The Assembly: End Game project is an interactive word-guessing game created using React.js and powered by Vite for a smooth development experience. In this game, users are given 8 chances to guess the correct letters of a word. For every incorrect guess, one programming language is removed from the display, and if all 8 chances are used up, the only language left is Assembly.

How It Works

The user is presented with a hidden word they need to guess, letter by letter.

They have a total of 8 chances to guess the correct letters.

For each incorrect guess, one language from the display is removed.

If all 8 chances are used without guessing the correct word, Assembly language will be the only one remaining, signaling the end of the game.
