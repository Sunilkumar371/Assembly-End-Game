# Assembly: End Game

## Overview

**Assembly: End Game** is an interactive word-guessing game built using **React.js** and powered by **Vite** for an optimized and smooth development experience. The game challenges users to guess the correct letters of a word within 8 chances. For every incorrect guess, a programming language is removed from the display. If the user fails to guess the word in 8 attempts, **Assembly** language remains, marking the end of the game.
